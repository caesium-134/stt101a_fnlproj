STT101 FINAL PROJECT 

To those who will work on simulations as project you may use below as guide; if more than one group, should be a different programming language.

Part 1 User enters population data
       - Display population size, population mean, variance and standard deviation

Part 2 User enters sample size, display partial list of samples, first 10 or 20 maybe (since too many if n is big, like 10, etc.)

Part 3
      A. Display mean, standard deviation and variance of sample mean 
 and compared with population mean, variance and standard deviation and verifies that:
       B. Mean of 
 is same as population mean
       C. Variance of 
is population variance divided by sample size n
       D. Standard deviation of 
 is population standard deviation divided by square root of sample size n.
       E.  Display the graph of the sampling distribution of 
 and any graphic/s you think may be helpful to understand the simulations.
